# üìù Project Notes ‚Äî Homelessness SQL Exploration

## Purpose of This Project
This project explores trends in U.S. homelessness using the BigQuery public dataset. It demonstrates:
- SQL querying skills
- Data segmentation
- Insight extraction
- Analytical storytelling

## Analytical Focus Areas
- Total homelessness by state
- Unsheltered population severity
- Youth homelessness concentration
- Shelter infrastructure comparison
- State-specific deep dive (Delaware)

## Interesting Observations
- Warm climates correlate with higher unsheltered homelessness.
- Population-dense areas face increased youth homelessness.
- States with strong shelter policy frameworks appear below the 2% threshold.

## Limitations
- Point-in-time dataset (single year snapshot)
- No cost or funding context included
- Youth definitions vary between states

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add year-over-year trend analysis
- Compare shelter capacity vs. demand
- Integrate cost-of-living data
- Add homelessness prevention metrics
